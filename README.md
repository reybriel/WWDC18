# WWDC18

My WWDC18 scholarship project is a simple game with a minimalist design that aims to make people step inside a disabled person shoes and understand the importance of accessibility to those that need it. I personally have a profound relashionship with that subject since I have an autistic sister, who was the main inspiration for this project.
